The content in our digital products and messages shape how our users perceive and use our platforms to get things done. Our writing must help our users understand and take action.

## Heading and subheadings

Headings and subheadings in our interfaces have three goals:

- Help users identify their **place**.
- Help users understand how things are **organized**.
- Help users predict what **actions** they can take.

Some specific guidelines for writing headings and subheadings:

- **Be concise.** Headings and subheadings should be scannable and use only as many words are needed to convey their meaning.
- **Write in sentence case.** Sentence case makes it feel less stiff and formal.
- **Don’t use punctuation** like periods or semicolons.

### Yes
- Your next read

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Your Next Read.

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

### Conversational headings
When we’re talking, we connect words with articles like “the,” “for,” “these,” and “an.” If we remove these from our writing, it makes our copy feel stiff and complicated. For conversational headings, use articles and write full sentences.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Read these next

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Read next

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

### Microcopy
For labels and microcopy, prioritize short and actionable content by removing articles like “the” and “an.”

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Add book

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Add this book

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

## Sentences
Sentences should provide real value and next steps for our users. They help users cycle between “What’s going on?” and “What do I do next?”

Some specific guidelines for writing sentences:

### Put action before outcome

Start sentences with strong verbs that help users understand what they will do. Include what the outcome of the action will be.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Add a book to your favourites. 

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Books appear in your favourites after you add them.

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

### Use verbs instead of verb-noun phrases

Look for combinations of verbs and nouns that can be replaced by a single verb.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- We will **refund** your subscription.

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- We will **provide a refund** for your subscription.

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

### Don’t use permissive language

Give users confidence about what they should do.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Update your favourite list and get tailored recommendations for your next read.

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Update your favourite list and you can get the recommendations for books you’ll love most.

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

## Buttons
Buttons are one of the most important elements in our digital platforms. Most actions and conversions are the direct result of the user clicking a button, and the labels used in buttons help users understand what actions are possible and are at the point when a decision becomes an action.

Always write button labels in sentence case.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Send suggestion

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Send Suggestion

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

### Buttons for action

When buttons enable user actions, the formula is `verb` + `noun`.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Add book
- Explore recommendations

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Add
- Explore

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

### Buttons in confirmations

When buttons are used as calls to action in confirmations, the formula `verb` + `noun` doesn’t have to be followed. Instead, use a verb to clearly convey outcomes, by connecting action to outcome.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Dicard changes? **Cancel / Discard**

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Discard changes? **No / Yes**

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

### Buttons for conversion

When buttons support conversion goals, the formula is `value` + `relevance`.

Instead of writing about what the user does (the action), write about what the user gets (the value). Then, make it more immediately relevant to the specific conversion context.

The length of a button label when the button’s purpose is conversion isn’t usually a problem.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Send a friend a free book

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Send gift

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

### Buttons as microcopy

Buttons can also be an opportunity to use microcopy to create a more positive experience (particularly in negative situations) by making the interface more human. If it’s appropriate, break the rules and explore ways to match the user’s feelings without assigning emotion.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- I tried, I’m stuck, I need help

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### Instead of
- Get help

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

## Links

Links should provide information about what to expect about the associated actions or destination. Users should be able to predict what will happen as a result of clicking a link.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- View [publication information](#).

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Want publication information? [Click here](#).

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

### In sentences

Links in full sentences shouldn’t link the whole sentence, but instead only the text that describes the outcome of clicking the link.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Create your [favourites list](#).

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- [Create your favourites list](#).

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

### Outside of sentences

Links that aren’t in full sentences should be treated similarly to buttons, and use the `verb` + `noun` pattern. Don’t punctuate, except with questions marks.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- [Remove from list](#)
- [Don’t have an account?](#)

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- [Remove from list.](#).
- [Don’t have an account](#)

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

## Error messages

Error messages have three goals:

- Explain simply and clearly that there is a problem and what that problem is.
- Provide a solution so that users can return and complete the process immediately.
- Turn the delay into an experience that is as pleasant as possible.

Some specific things to keep in mind when writing error messages:

### Write without rigidity

Keep it conversational. Adjusting the tone of voice to be more formal rather than casual is appropriate, but use restraint.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Postal code should have 6 digits

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Postal code is invalid

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

### Write without using the words error or failure

Again, keep it conversational. We’d never say “error!” in conversation if we didn’t understand something.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Sorry, we couldn’t save your changes. Try again?

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Failed to save changes.

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

## Confirmation messages

Confirmation messages and dialogues are shown when users take an action that can’t be undone, or is difficult to undo.

Confirmation **messages** should:

- Give the users a chance to confirm or cancel their action
- Be shown in response to a single action
- Always include one or two calls to action

Confirmation message **titles** should:

- Ask if they want to continue, using a `verb` + `noun` question.
- Write in sentence case. Sentence case makes it feel less stiff and formal.
- Don’t use punctuation like periods or semicolons, other than a question mark.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Discard unsaved changes?

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Discard?

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

Confirmation message **body content** should:

- Use plain language to explain action is irreversible or difficult to undo.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- This can’t be undone

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- If you discard changes, your list will remain unchanged.

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

Confirmation message **calls to action** should:

- Clearly convey outcomes, by connection action to outcome.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Discard changes? **Cancel** / **Discard**

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Discard changes? **No** / **Yes**

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>
    
Special case: in the context of canceling accounts, use “Never mind” instead of “cancel” to prevent confusion.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Never mind / Cancel account

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Cancel / Cancel account

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

## Success messages

Success messages are shown to users in response to an action they performed, when it succeeds.

Success messages have three goals:

- Provide certainty to the users that the action was completed, and that everything is okay.
- Provide next steps for users, whether optional or mandatory.
- Provide positivity. When things go well, we can magnify the positive feeling and create affinity for our experience.

Some specific things to keep in mind when writing success messages:

### Talk about or to the user, not about the action

While it’s important to provide certainty that what the user wanted to do actually happened, it doesn’t need to be in the template “X successfully completed.” Sometimes, this certainty can even be implicit.

Imagine if we let people share a book recommendation. When the recommendation is sent, we need to show a success message so they can be confident the recommendation was delivered.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Recommendation sent! Sharing is caring.

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Recommendation successfully sent.

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

### If possible, provide a deeper and meaningful aspect of the action taken

Use success messages to reinforce the value that our users get from taking a given action.

If a user adds a book to their favourites list, treat the success message as an opportunity to reinforce that choice.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Added to your favourites! Now others will be able to give you even better recommendations.

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Book added to your favourites list.

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

## Empty states

Empty states are everywhere. They appear when there’s nothing to show. Sometimes, they appear when the user has yet to add something to a set of items. Other times, they appear when they try to find something and can’t.

An empty state is a chance to educate users about what’s supposed to be there, what can be done there, and how it will provide value to the user.

Some specific guidelines to keep in mind when writing content for empty states:

### Remember, empty states aren’t a bad thing

Avoid using negative words or phrases. Empty states are transitional and reveal potential. Say what’s supposed to be here, or what can be done here, and how it will help them.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Your favourite books will appear here!

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Oh no, there’re no books in your favourites list

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

### Provide a next step

If relevant, tell users exactly how to start using a feature and provide an action they can take.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- New recommendations from other users will appear here. [Ask for your first recommendation!](#)

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- No recommendations

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

## Placeholders

Placeholders appear in form inputs before the user enters text. As a general rule of thumb, placeholders should be avoided except in very specific situations covered below.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Use placeholders for:
- Fields we really want users to complete.
- Fields that users might not understand.

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### Don’t use placeholders as:
- Labels for form input fields.
- Formatting guidelines.

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

We use a few different approaches to placeholders.

### Questions

When we really want users to complete a field, we can use placeholders to prompt a question for users to respond to. This should be direct and in the second person, and should have a simple, short answer.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- What’s your favourite book?

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

### Categories

When the response to an input field might be from a wide range of options, placeholders can be used to reduce the number of choices and provide guidelines for how to respond to the field.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Filter books by author, genre

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

### Examples

Sometimes, an example will make it easier for users to understand how to answer a field.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- Such as “‘Harry Potter’ mixed with ‘A Gentleman in Moscow’”

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>

## Helper messages

Sometimes, our users need a bit of help. Helper messages help us support our users when they’re filling out forms or taking an action.

Some specific guidelines for writing helper messages:

### Do users need help?

Before adding helper messages, ask whether users actually need help. The more messages we include on a page or form, the more intimidating it appears to our users.

### Be concise

This is particularly important for helper messages on input fields.

<UsageBlock>
<Usage type="yes">

### Yes
- 8–12 characters

</Usage>
<Usage type="no">

### No
- Password must be between 8–12 characters

</Usage>
</UsageBlock>
