One of the ways we create a consistent and familiar experience for our users is by speaking with a consistent voice throughout our product and content while being aware of our tone.

## What’s the difference between voice and tone?

One of the ways we create a consistent and familiar experience for our users is by speaking with a consistent voice throughout our product and content while being aware of our tone.

What’s the difference between voice and tone? Think of it this way: our **voice** is a personification of who we are. We always have the same voice. But, our **tone** changes to match our context and situation.

For example, when our customers are cooking their first meal, they might be feeling excited, successful, and maybe a bit nervous. We can cheer them on and congratulate them when they’re finished cooking.

But when our customers experience something going wrong, such as an ingredient missing from their box, they’re probably feeling annoyed and a bit stressed out. We can recognize what went wrong, apologize, and tell them what will happen next.

## Voice guidelines

Each of our brands has a distinct voice and character. But since we use Pistachio, the foundation for all of our digital platforms, we have a **shared voice** that’s the basis of our writing for all of our digital platforms. We write first in this voice and then build off of it to infuse each brand’s unique personality.

When we write in our shared voice, we are always:

``TODO: This section is in an early draft form.``

### Optimistic

- Give people energy through our own positivity
- Help our customers succeed and don’t talk down to them
- Assume positive intent, even when things go wrong

### Conversational

- Be plain-spoken
- Use our user’s language
   
### Authentic

- Communicate clearly and honestly, even when we make a mistake
- Be direct but compassionate
- Let our love for cooking and food shine through

When we build off of our shared voice for **Marley Spoon**, we are also:

### Confident

- Speak with confidence
- Be specific when explaining
    
### Interested

- Be empathetic
    
### Interesting

- Connect our love for food to the richness of life

When we build off of our shared voice for **Dinnerly**, we are also:

### Quirky

- Our sense of humour doesn’t take itself too seriously. We’re obviously punny and straight-faced, but never sarcastic or cynical.
    
### Playful

- ``TODO``
    
### Down to earth

- Connect our love for food to the richness of life
    
## Using tone of voice

Our tone is more than just the words we choose: it’s the way that we choose to share our personality through our voice.

We can express any given message in wildly different ways. To find the right tone for any given message, consider the four dimensions of tone of voice:

1. Funny vs. serious.
2. Formal vs. casual.
3. Respectful vs. irreverent.
4. Enthusiastic vs. matter-of-fact.

Vary these dimensions to meet the user’s emotional and situational context at a given moment in time.

### Positive situations

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Be encouraging
- Express authentic pride
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Don’t take credit for their success
- Don’t assume it was easy
</Usage>
```

### Neutral situations

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Express confidence and connect value
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Don’t create uncertainty or tell people “what to do”
</Usage>
```

### Negative situations

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Be honest and direct about problems and provide next steps
- Use conversational but straightforward language
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Don’t minimize the problem
- Don’t use negative or technical words
</Usage>
```

When we write for our distinct brand voices, each brand has its own “range” along these dimensions of tone of voice. For example, Dinnerly can take a more enthusiastic tone of voice than Marley Spoon for a message for the same positive situation.
