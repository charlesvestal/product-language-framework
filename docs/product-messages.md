From time to time, we need to share messages with our users through our app and digital platforms about a variety of things. Our challenge is that not all messages are equal, and we need to communicate with our users in the right way at the right time for any given message.

Since “the right way at the right time“ is somewhat subjective, we’ve created a framework to make it easy to consistently choose the right way to share messages, and to make it simple to plan in-app communications for larger ongoing initiatives.

## Types of messages

We have three types of messages, in level of priority:


1. Interrupt
2. Contextual
3. Independent

Each type of message is supported in the mobile app in a few different ways.

## 1. Interrupt

An Interrupt does just that: interrupts whatever the user is currently trying to do, and prevents them from returning to their original goal until they do something about it.

### How the user interacts with an interrupt:

The user must **acknowledge** the interruption by either:

- Dismissing or closing the interruption
- Taking an action provided by the interruption

### When to use:

- Should be used with great restraint: by their very nature, interrupts get in the user’s way!
- The **positive benefit** of interrupting the user must always be greater than the **negative experience impact** of interrupting the user. Don’t underestimate the negative impact, or the cumulative “banner blindness” that users will develop if they’re frequently interrupted with information that **they** don’t value!

### What it looks like:

- Usually takes the form of a **takeover** in the mobile app.
- A more moderate interrupt is a **push notification**.

## 2. Contextual

A contextual message appears within something that it has a direct relationship with. user’s goal or location within the app. Any given message relies on the context that it appears within.

### A contextual message:

- Should provide direct and obvious value to both the user and business in terms of information provided or outcomes as a result of the message.
- Can have many forms, each tightly integrated into the context in which they belong. Can be both **active** (supports user interaction) or **passive** (provides information but no action available). When active, can result in **immediate outcome** or act as an **in-between** to direct users towards another context to accomplish a goal.

## 3. Independent

Can appear outside of a given context, and does not require any interaction. Primarily informative and provides additional depth.

### An independent message:

- Should (usually) not be strongly tied to app or experience performance metrics, as it is not intended to strongly drive behavioural outcomes.

### What it looks like:

- Can be a static or carousel-style message in the app, independent of its context.
- Email is usually independent.

## Message Planning

By using a simple three step process, it’s easy to plan how to communicate any given message or campaign throughout the app, in a way that will help us achieve our goals, help our users achieve their goals, and result in the best user experience outcomes.

1. Identify behavioural outcome.
2. Identify timeline and key moments.
3. Identify message priority for each key moment with the prioritization matrix.

### 1. Identify behavioural outcome

What user action or behaviour do we want to use to say “**this message did what it was supposed to do?**“

Different kinds of messages have different desired behavioural outcomes. Some examples:

- If an ingredient needs to be recalled due to a food poisoning event, the behavioural outcome is “**acknowledged recall notice.**”
- If we want users to provide a review for a recipe, the behavioural outcome is “**provided a rating.**”
- If a box’s normal delivery day is automatically changed due to a holiday on their regular delivery day, the behavioural outcome is “**engages with box**” (so that we are confident they are aware the day changed). In this case, “engaging with box” could mean that they’ve viewed the box in the “Upcoming” tab (mobile app), viewed the menu for that box (web platform), or even opened an email with information about the shifted delivery day.

### 2. Identify timeline and key moments

For any given topic or theme, it’s likely the urgency or potential impact of the message changes over time.

Take, for example, how we might approach messaging around someone’s normal delivery day automatically changing due to a holiday on their regular delivery day. We’ve already defined the behavioural outcome as “engages with box.”

- Three weeks before their box cutoff date, it’s not necessarily all that pressing if they don’t engage with the box.
- Three days before their box cutoff, it’s starting to get worrying if they don’t engage with the box. If they don’t realize their delivery day has changed, they might get a box when they don’t expect to, and that could either leave them hungry or surprise them in a not-so-great way when it arrives early.
- The day before cutoff, if they still haven’t engaged with the box, we should be rightfully worried. We don’t want our customer to be surprised, because that’s a poor user experience and might result in losing a valued customer.

Based on this series of events, we can say that there’s three key moments in the “automatically changed delivery day due to holiday” messaging.

1. Three weeks before cutoff
2. Three days before cutoff
3. One day before cutoff

Sometimes, there may not be any timeline associated with a message. If we have to recall an ingredient due to a food poisoning event, it’s likely to be a one-time thing. If we want users to provide a rating for something they’ve cooked, it’s likely to be a regular and constant thing. That’s fine too! Then, each message simply has a single key moment when it becomes relevant.

### 3. Identify message priority for each key moment with the prioritization matrix

With key moments in hand, the next step is to identify the message priority with the prioritization matrix. This is very easy to use.

First, consider the **impact** of the message in that key moment, for both the user and the business.
Second, consider how **urgent** the message is in that key moment.

Then, place the key moment into the prioritization matrix. Each space in the matric directly maps to a type of message!

``TODO Add image of matrix``

If you’re having trouble placing a moment into the matrix, consider whether the moment needs more context.

## Calibrating over time

By the very nature of having a framework like this, we’ll be able to improve our prioritization over time, because we can document all existing and past messages into the prioritization matrix, and use that to “calibrate” our own evaluations of urgency and impact.

## Building consensus

The matrix is also a good way to build consensus on a team. Consider having each member of the team independently place a given message or messages into the matrix based on their own judgement, without seeing other member’s placements. Then, compare the combined placements and use that as a basis for discussion.
