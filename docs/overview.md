Our language framework helps guide all of our writing for our digital platforms. The language and words we use have a deep impact on the user experience and our business outcomes.

Our goals for this framework are to:

- **Create consistency** across our platforms to make our experience usable, predictable, and delightful.
- **Empower our team** and make it easy for anyone working on our digital platforms to write clear, effective, and useful content.


## Writing for Pistachio

The Pistachio design system introduces an extra level of complexity in copywriting for our digital platforms.

Here are a few key mindsets for writing for our digital platforms:

- **Write for Pistachio first.** Treat it like a “base layer” that you’ll build on to capture and convey a distinct personality for each of our brands.
- **Use the same words to describe nouns and verbs.** By using the same words, we’ll create a consistent and usable experience for all of our brands.
- **Use voice and tone to reflect each brand’s personality.** For more, see the Voice & Tone section.
