At Marley Spoon, we’re bringing delightful, market-fresh, and easy cooking back to the people. We build products and tools to help people save time and cook delicious meals at home.

Our experience principles are at the heart of how we design and build our digital products. They give us a shared point of view for conversations and decisions in our work.

Our experience principles are:

## Treasure time

We help people enjoy cooking and trying new things while spending their time on the things they enjoy. When our digital products fit in, it must be a purposeful use of time.

## Users in control

Minimise uncertainties, prevent surprises, and reduce the mental load of decision-making to give people control over their experience.

## Everyone can cook

Our products are used by a worldwide community of all abilities. Anticipate the stress cases and design for inclusion so that everyone can cook.

## Fits like the perfect kitchen

Like the perfect kitchen, everything has its place and time: everything’s easy to find, intuitive, and supports the task at hand.

## Trustworthy

Trust must be earned, and it’s reciprocal: for people to give us their trust, we must give them transparency and consistency.
