At Marley Spoon, we have a unique challenge: we have several distinct brands that share a single underlying technological platform.

Pistachio is how we’re meeting this challenge. It’s a design system: a living system of guidelines, reusable code, design assets, and tools that help us deliver a delightful experiences at scale.

The benefits of our design system are:

- **Do more with less.** Whenever we design and build a new feature, we use Pistachio as the basis for our work. This lets us design, validate, and ship more quickly, across all of our brands at once.
- **Get the details right.** By having a single source of truth for all of our digital platforms, we create consistency for our brand and user experience.
- **Delight our customers.** By using Pistachio as the basis for our work, we can constantly improve on our experience by building on well-defined and learned behaviours.

The Pistachio design system will eventually contain:

- Principles and goals
- Guidelines (for copywriting, UX & UI, and tech)
- Tools (a UI component library in Figma, pattern library, and more)
- Examples and best practices
- Brand identity assets

We have a long way to go, but we’re making Pistachio available today so that we can bring it into our work right away.
