We have an editorial style for our digital products to help us keep our copy clear and consistent, and specific guidelines to write and structure content to make it easy for users to understand and act on.

## Abbreviations & acronyms

Avoid abbreviations and acronyms when possible.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- for example
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- e.g.
</Usage>
```

## Adverbs and adjectives

Try to avoid adjectives and adverbs. Using adjectives and adverbs (for example, “easy” recipe) shapes perception and sets expectations, and can inadvertently lead to a negative emotional experience for our customers. 

If someone is new to cooking and feels nervous about their abilities, then describing a recipe as “easy” can help them choose that recipe. But if they have trouble cooking it, they may feel bad because the recipe was supposed to be “easy,” and they still had trouble.

Instead, look for opportunities to capture the same meaning through other forms. What makes an “easy” recipe easy relative to other recipes? Can that be used as a scale of relative difficulty?

## Active voice vs. passive voice

Use active voice and avoid passive voice. In active voice, the subject of the sentence does the action. In passive voice, the subject of the sentence has the action done to it.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Added recipe to box.
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- The recipe was added to box.
</Usage>
```

Use passive voice when you don’t want to assign responsibility for an action. This can reduce tension in a message.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Delivery address was incorrect.
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Wrong delivery address provided.
</Usage>
```

## Present tense

Use present tense to describe the result of actions.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Recipe added
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Recipe has been added
</Usage>
```

## Capitalization

We use different forms of capitalization depending on the context.

For example, use title case for recipe names and weekly status messages, and use sentence case for recipe steps. If you’re not sure which capitalization to use, check the design system for existing conventions.

All-caps should be used sparingly and only for specific purposes. Never use all-caps within a sentence. 

## Contractions

Use contractions like “we’ll” or “there’s!” They make our writing more conversational. 

However, don’t rely on contractions alone for a conversational voice. When we translate copy for our global audience, they almost won’t carry over.

## Conversational writing

Our voice is conversational. When we’re talking, we connect words with articles like “the,” “for,” “these,” and “an.” If we remove these from our writing, it makes our copy feel stiff and complicated. We can be flexible, though. If space is a limitation, the article can be omitted.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Choose a recipe
- Save your changes
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Choose recipe
- Save changes
</Usage>
```

## Avoid directional language

Avoid any instructions or language that requires the user to see the layout or design of a page or element.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Choose a new delivery time.
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Choose a new delivery time at the bottom right of this page.
</Usage>
```

## Numbers

Use the numeral when numbers appear in copy. This includes ordinals (numbers that tell the position of something in a list).

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- You have 3 meals in your box
- 2 days left to make changes
- This is your 3rd box
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- You have three meals in your box
- Two days left to make changes
- This is your third box
</Usage>
```

When writing in English, numbers over 3 digits get commas.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- 144
- 1,200
</Usage>
```

When writing in German, Swedish, and Dutch, numbers over 3 digits get a period.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- 144
- 1.200
</Usage>
```

### Dates

Spell out the day of the week and the month whenever possible. Abbreviate when space is a limitation. When abbreviated in interface headings and labels, do not use a period.

The order of day and month should match the user’s locale.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- **USA:** Thursday, April 16
- **USA:** April 16
- **USA:** Apr 16
- **Germany:** Thursday, 16 April
- **Germany:** 16 April
- **Germany:** 16 Apr
</Usage>
```

When possible, use natural language to describe dates.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Today
- Yesterday
- Tomorrow
- This week
- Next week
- Two weeks from now
</Usage>
```

### Fractions

Use typographic fractions when referencing measurements in ingredients. Don’t spell fractions out.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- ½
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- 1/2
- one-half
</Usage>
```

### Percentages

Use the % symbol instead of spelling out “percent.”

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- 2%
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Two percent
</Usage>
```

### Ranges and spans

Use an en dash (`–`) to indicate a range or span of numbers. Do not use spaces before and after the en dash.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Cook for 10–20 minutes
</Usage>
```

An en dash is slightly wider than a hyphen (`-`) but narrower than an em dash (`—`).

### Money

When writing about US or AU currency, use the dollar sign ($) before the amount. Always include a decimal and number of cents. Do not insert a space between the dollar sign and the number.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- $10.00
- $42.99
</Usage>
```

When writing about EUR currency, use the Euro sign (€) after the amount. Always include a comma and number of cents. Insert a space between the number and the Euro sign.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- 10,00 €
- 42,99 €
</Usage>
```

### Telephone numbers

Use dashes without spaces between numbers. Don’t use a country code.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- 866-228-4513
- 030-208-480-510
- 02-6145-2910
</Usage>
```

### Temperature

Use the degree symbol and capital C abbreviation for Celsius (everywhere except the USA) or capital F abbreviation for Fahrenheit (USA only). Don’t insert spaces between the number and the abbreviation.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- 220°C
- 425°F
</Usage>
```

### Time

When writing about a time of the day, use numerals and lowercase am or pm, with a space in between. Use 12- or 24-hour time according to the locale. When writing in 24-hour time, show a `0` before single-digit hours. 

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- 5 pm
- 8:30 pm
- 06:30
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- 5pm
- 8:30PM
- 6:30h
</Usage>
```

Use an en dash (`–`) between times to indicate a time period. Don’t insert spaces before and after the en dash.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- 8 am–12 pm 
- 06:30–18:00 
</Usage>
```

When referring to an amount of time, use numerals and the full word, with a space in between.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Cook for 20 minutes.
- Steam for 30 seconds.
</Usage>
```

### Units of measurement

In all cases, include a space between the number and the unit of measurement.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- 100 g
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- 100g
</Usage>
```

## Punctuation

### Apostrophes

Apostrophes are usually used to make a word possessive. If the word already ends in an s and it’s singular, you also add an’s. If the word ends in an s and is plural, just add an apostrophe.

Watch out for dumb apostrophes (`'`). These are a relic of typewriters, and can be identified by how they’re straight rather than curly. Always use typographic apostrophes (`‘`).

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- This recipe’s best cooked within 3 days.
- This recipe is Martha’s favourite.
- Chris’s favourite recipe
</Usage>
```

### Colons

Use a colon to offset a list.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Gather three things before starting: pots, pans, and knives.
When a list begins with an interface label, capitalize the first word of the list.
- Allergens: Dairy, peanuts, and anchovies.
</Usage>
```

### Commas

Use the Oxford comma when writing a list.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Allergens include dairy, peanuts, and anchovies.
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Allergens include dairy, peanuts and anchovies.
</Usage>
```

### Dashes and hyphens

Use a hyphen (`-`) without spaces before and after to link words into a single phrase.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- First-time cook?
</Usage>
```

Use an en dash (`–`) to indicate a [range or span](#ranges-and-spans), without spaces.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Cook for 10–20 minutes
</Usage>
```

Use an em (`—`) dash without spaces to separate clauses in paragraph copy.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Our new smoothies—you’ll be delighted to hear—are perfect for gluten-free diets.
</Usage>
```

### Ellipses

Use ellipses to indicate that a line of copy has been clipped before the end. This is typically used when only a single line of copy will fit, but the content itself is too long. Avoid this when possible.

When ellipses are used to clip a line of copy, clip after at least 2 characters.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Free-Range Heritage Chicken With Sc…
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Free-Range Heritage Chicken With S…
</Usage>
```

### Periods

Use periods in complete sentences. Don’t use periods in headlines or labels. Periods go inside quotation marks. They go outside parentheses ( ) when the contained text is part of a larger sentence, and inside when the contained text stands alone.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- 3 meals in your box
- Your delivery was rescheduled to Tuesday because of a holiday (St. Patrick’s Day).
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- 3 meals in your box.
</Usage>
```

### Quotation marks

Watch out for dumb quotation marks (`'` and `"`). These are a relic of typewriters, and can be identified by how they’re straight rather than curly. Always use typographic quotation marks (`‘` and `’`, `“` and `”`).

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- ‘Example’
- “Example Two”
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- 'Example'
- "Example two"
</Usage>
```

## Places

Spell out all city names. 

When written in paragraph copy, write out country, state, and province names on the first mention. On subsequent mentions, abbreviating is fine.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Now available in Sweden.
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Now available in SWE.
</Usage>
```

## Positive vs negative

Use positive language rather than negative language. Positives are easier to read and process than negatives. One way to detect negative language is to look for words like “can’t,” “don’t,” etc.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Update your payment method to get your box.
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- If you don’t update your payment method, you won’t get your box.
</Usage>
```

## Use positive words when talking about positive things

If a sentence begins with a negative word, the sentence’s implication can be misinterpreted as negative.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Remember to save your new payment method
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Don’t forget to save your new payment method
</Usage>
```

## Writing questions

A common error when writing questions is not constructing the sentence as a question. Usually, this can be fixed by changing the word order.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Why should meat and vegetables be chopped on separate cooking boards?
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Why meat and vegetables should be chopped on separate cooking boards?  
</Usage>
```

## Writing about ourselves

We have a few different names depending on whether we’re referring to our legal entity or our trade name, and which market we’re writing for.

In our digital products, use our trade name for each market:

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- **EU:** Marley Spoon
- **US:** Martha & Marley Spoon, Dinnerly
- **AU:** Marley Spoon, Dinnerly
</Usage>
```

Always title case our name. Don’t abbreviate our name.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Martha & Marley Spoon
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Martha & Marley spoon
- MMS  
</Usage>
```

Don’t capitalize descriptive product or feature names.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- our mobile app
- taste profile
- your box
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- our Mobile App
- Taste Profile
- your Box
</Usage>
```

## Writing about people

We design and build our platforms with a human-centered point of view. Whenever we write something for our digital platforms, we need to write in a way that’s compassionate, inclusive, and respectful.

Here are some specific guidelines for how we write about people.

### Disability

Avoid disability-related idioms like “lame” or “falling on deaf ears.”

Default to person-first language rather than identity-first language.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- they have a disability
- person with disability
- people living with disabilities
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- they are disabled
- disabled person
</Usage>
```

Do not use the term “edge cases” to describe users living with disabilities. This term further marginalizes people already living on the margins. Instead, use the term “stress cases.”

### Gender and sexuality

Don’t call groups of people “guys.” Don’t call women “girls.” `(Quoting from Mailchimp)`

Avoid gendered terms.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Deliveryperson
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Deliveryman
</Usage>
```

``TODO How does the adapt to other languages like German?``

It’s okay to use “they” as a singular pronoun.

### Hearing

Use lower-case “deaf,” “hard of hearing,” or “hearing loss” as adjectives to describe someone with hearing loss.

### Vision

Use lower-case “blind” to describe someone who is unable to see. Use “low vision” or “vision loss” as adjectives to describe a person with limited vision.

## Avoid words with multiple meanings

Some words to watch out for:

**Once** (could mean “one time,” “after,” “in the past,” or “when”)

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- After you’ve made your choices
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Once you’ve made your choice
</Usage>
```

**Right** (could mean “correct,” “the opposite of left,” “politically conservative,” etc.)

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Pick the right recipe
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Pick the recipe you like most
</Usage>
```

**Since** (could refer to a point in time, or a synonym of “because”)

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Because you have a referral already, you can invite a friend to get a free box
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- Since you already have a referral, you can invite a friend to get a free box
</Usage>
```

**“Require” plus an infinitive** (could confuse the relationship between subject and object)

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- Referrals can be sent from any Marley Spoon account.
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- A Marley Spoon account is required to send referrals. _(This could imply that both the sender and receiver have to have a Marley Spoon account to send a referral.)_
</Usage>
```

## Avoid idioms

In most languages, idioms are commonly-known phrases packed with meaning. However, idioms don’t often translate into other languages. They can also create confusion for translators that have English as an additional language.

```usage
<Usage type="yes">
### Yes
- `TODO`
</Usage>
<Usage type="no">
### No
- `TODO`
</Usage>
```
